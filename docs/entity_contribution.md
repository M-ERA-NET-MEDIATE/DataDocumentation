# How to contribute with new entities?

## Development phase

For entities that are not yet mature (frequent breaking changes, no parser developed yet, etc.), they should not be stored in that repository.
Version 0.x are excluded.

## Mature entities

When an entity is mature to be called at the minimum version 1.0, it must be moved into this repo and removed in the development folder.

The entity should then be accessed through onto-ns server directly.
This is the "official version".

If changes in the entity are required, the procedure to upload a new version should be strictly followed. (link to be added later)
